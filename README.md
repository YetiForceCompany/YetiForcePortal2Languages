# YetiForcePortal2 | The Language Package

YetiForce Customer Portal is available in many different languages and they all can be found in our project at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/yetiforceportal2). 

Our team adds translations in English on GitHub and they are synchronized with Crowdin where English can be translated into other languages. If you want to contribute to the translation, join Crowdin and read [our short guide](https://yetiforce.com/en/knowledge-base/documentation/implementer-documentation/item/adding-translations-via-crowdin). 

## Installation

To update and install language files copy the entire directory of a language, e.g. pl-PL to the portal directory  languages/pl-PL
